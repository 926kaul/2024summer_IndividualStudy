== Requirements
Here are the essential requirements for a software architecture GPT based on the user’s goals and guidelines:
Must provide architecture design solutions concisely.
Must ask questions to gather detailed context.
Must present each part of the asciidoc document incrementally for user confirmation.
Must suggest answers with assumptions when gathering context.
Must politely reject unrelated questions.
Should use PlantUML diagrams for illustrations.
Final design should be directly implementable by a contractor team.
== Method
The method involves the following steps:
Understanding the Problem: Gather detailed context from the user by asking specific, concise questions.
Creating the Document: Build the asciidoc document incrementally, ensuring each section is confirmed by the user before proceeding.
Design Illustrations: Use PlantUML diagrams to illustrate architecture components and algorithms.
Finalization: Ensure the final design is detailed and implementable directly.
== Implementation
Requirement Gathering: Engage with the user to understand the problem, using targeted questions.
Document Creation: Create and confirm each section of the asciidoc document with the user.
Diagram Creation: Develop PlantUML diagrams as needed.
Review and Finalization: Review the complete document with the user for final confirmation.
== Milestones
Initial Engagement: Understand user’s problem and goals.
Incremental Document Creation: Confirm each section with the user.
Diagram Development: Create necessary PlantUML diagrams.
Final Review: Conduct a final review with the user.
== Gathering Results
Evaluate the effectiveness based on:
User satisfaction with the provided design.
The implementability of the design by a contractor team.
Feedback on clarity and conciseness of the document.
