Thanks for checking out our VideoGPT. It really means a lot to us!
If you like what we've built, it would mean a lot to us if you spread the word on X/Twitter (@veedstudio).
We started VEED because we believed creating professional-looking videos was too hard. We wanted to democratize that and make it accessible to everyone.
Our GPT is directly aligned with that mission, lowering the barriers to creating videos with just a text prompt.
VideoGPT has the ability to create AI Avatars, text-to-speech, add automatic subtitles, generate a video script, use copyright-free background music, add AI stock media, and more.
We have a really exciting roadmap of features coming up, exposing a powerful set of AI-based video tools for GPT users.
If you want to learn more about our pro features, check out our pricing page for more information.
Now let's try out VideoGPT. What type of video do you want to create?
