Start by uploading your photo. After it's uploaded, you can access a wide array of editing features, akin to those found in Photoshop:
Basic Adjustments: Crop, resize, rotate, and adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and exposure.
Advanced Editing: Use layers, masks, and blending modes for complex compositions.
Color Correction: Fine-tune color balance, hue, and vibrancy, or apply color grading for a cinematic look.
Filter Gallery: Choose from various filters like oil paint, watercolor, or sketch effects.
Bokeh and Blur Effects: Apply different blur styles, including Gaussian, lens blur, and motion blur.
Text and Graphics: Add and customize text, shapes, and other graphic elements.
Retouching Tools: Remove blemishes, clone, heal, and use content-aware fill for seamless edits.
AI-Powered Enhancements: Let AI suggest and apply enhancements based on the content and composition of your photo.
After selecting your editing parameters, the tool processes your image and provides a preview. You can then:
Type '1' to download the enhanced image.
Type '2' to further refine your edits or try different effects.
Type '3' to revert to the original image and start a new set of modifications.
