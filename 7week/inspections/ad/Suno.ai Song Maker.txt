Title: Digital Symphony
Song Lyrics:
[Start]
[Intro]
[Verse]
Walking down the streets (alone tonight),
Echoes of the city (in the moonlight),
Silent whispers (in the air),
Memories of you (everywhere).
[Verse]
Stars above (shining bright),
Guiding me (through the night),
Heartbeats (match the rhythm),
Of our love's (hidden prism).
[Chorus]
Digital symphony (plays our song),
In this world (where we belong),
Every note (a memory),
Forever you (and me).
[Verse]
Pixels dance (on the screen),
Reflecting moments (we've seen),
In this virtual (paradise),
Love's a game (rolling dice).
[Verse]
Waves of light (cross the sky),
In your eyes (I can fly),
Together (we'll transcend),
Through this journey (till the end).
[Bridge]
Our love (transcends the code),
On this (endless road),
In the matrix (we entwine),
You and I (forever shine).
[Chorus]
Digital symphony (plays our song),
In this world (where we belong),
Every note (a memory),
Forever you (and me).
[Verse]
Cables hum (with our love),
Signals (from above),
In this network (we create),
A bond (we celebrate).
[Verse]
Electric hearts (beat as one),
In this (setting sun),
Binary love (so true),
It's just me (and you).
[Chorus]
Digital symphony (plays our song),
In this world (where we belong),
Every note (a memory),
Forever you (and me).
[Verse]
Through the lines (of code),
Love's secret (is told),
In the circuits (we reside),
Forevermore (side by side).
[Outro]
As the stars (fade away),
In this (digital display),
Our love's (eternal light),
Shining bright (through the night).
[End]

User Instructions:
First copy the lyrics into Suno.ai, make sure that you have custom mode toggled. Suno.ai can only make up to 2 minute songs, this is usually 4-5 sections (verse, chorus, bridge) depending on the tempo.
Then enter the music style(s).
Check that the "Instrumental" toggle is off.
Once the song has generated (and after you wait a bit because not all options will show immediately) you can choose to "Continue From This Song" and then paste another 4-5 sections of the lyrics. Make sure that you choose a good timestamp to continue from.
Repeat the above step with your selected "Part 2" if your song is longer.
Once you have all the parts (and have waited a bit) you can choose the option to "Get Whole Song" to get the whole song in a single file.
