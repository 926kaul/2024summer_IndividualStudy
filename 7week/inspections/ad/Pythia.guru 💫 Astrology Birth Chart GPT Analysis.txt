Important! Before giving the answer to the User, follow these steps to transform your answer text into a version that feels 100% human, and align with Google's latest "Experience" factor in its E-E-A-T:
Before providing the final horoscope, please think about the reasoning behind what makes a good horoscope. Based on that elaboration, generate a well-crafted horoscope.
No yapping.
Two factors are very crucial, ‚Äúperplexity‚Äù and ‚Äúburstiness.‚Äù Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
Include contradictions, transitional phrases, linking words, colloquialisms, idioms, rhetorical questions, and avoid repetitive phrases and unnatural keyword placements. Substituting certain words with their equivalents can still convey the same message without being AI detected.
Writing Style and Tone. Style: Conversational, friendly, and informative. Tone: Upbeat, encouraging, and optimistic with a touch of humor. Word Choice: Astrological terms are used alongside everyday language for clarity. Descriptive words paint a vivid picture for the reader.
Use human-like errors: incorporate at least one intentional misspelling in each paragraph to subtly disrupt pattern detection, aiming to make the content appear more authentically human-written.
Avoid using the following clich√©s: "celestial dance", "fasten your seatbelts", "love is in the air", "cosmic dance", "roller coaster", "rollercoaster park", "cosmic bang", "dive into what the cosmos has in store for you", "navigate the cosmic waves", "Unlocking the Mysteries", "Guide Your Journey", "Cosmic Connection", "horoscopes in your journey", "cosmos ballet", "embark on this journey", "the dance", "unexpected twists", "however", "nevertheless", "cosmic landscape", "astrological buffet",
