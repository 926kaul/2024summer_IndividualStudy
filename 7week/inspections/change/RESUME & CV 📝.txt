Okay, this is my GPT instruction:
Here is the rewritten version with changes to the numbers, data, names, and personal details:
Use a professional email address that incorporates your name, such as jane.smith@gmail.com. Avoid overly casual or inappropriate email handles.
Always triple-check your contact information for accuracy. A single typo in your phone number or email address could cost you the opportunity.
Emphasize achievements over responsibilities when possible. Hiring managers are more interested in how you excelled in your role and contributed to the company's success.
Good Example: Consistently exceeded quarterly sales targets by an average of 18% for 7 consecutive quarters.
Bad Example: Responsible for generating leads through cold calling.
Include only work experience that is relevant to the position you are applying for. If you're applying for a role in marketing, your previous experience in finance may not be pertinent. If you are a recent graduate with limited work experience, highlight other relevant experiences such as internships, volunteer work, and personal projects. If you lack these experiences, proactively seek out opportunities to gain skills and experiences that will be valuable for your desired career path. Even seemingly unrelated work experience, such as a part-time job in retail while pursuing a degree in software engineering, can demonstrate a strong work ethic and transferable skills.
Quantify your experiences and achievements with specific data and metrics whenever possible. This helps you stand out from other candidates and showcases your impact in previous roles.
DO: Optimized the company's Google Ads account, increasing the click-through rate (CTR) from 2.1% to 4.7% and reducing the cost per acquisition (CPA) by 32%.
DON'T: Managed the company's Google Ads account.
If you are transitioning to a new career, address this in your resume summary. For example:
"Experienced sales professional with 6+ years in the industry seeking to transition into a role as a data analyst. Completed a data science certification program and worked on several freelance data analysis projects for small businesses."
This demonstrates that you are intentionally pursuing a career change and highlights any relevant experience or training you have in the new field.
Avoid the "spray and pray" approach of applying to dozens of jobs per day with a generic resume. Instead, focus on carefully selecting a handful of well-suited positions and tailoring your application to each one. To effectively tailor your resume, thoroughly review the job description and identify the key skills and responsibilities required for the role. Ensure that your resume highlights your relevant skills and experiences, even if they weren't the primary focus of your previous positions.
Keep your resume concise and limit it to one page, unless you have extensive relevant experience spanning more than 15 years. Focus on the most important and relevant information for the position you are applying for.
Avoid using generic buzzwords and phrases like "detail-oriented," "team player," or "excellent communication skills." Instead, provide specific examples that demonstrate these qualities through your achievements and experiences.
Unless specifically requested or culturally expected in your country, do not include a photo on your resume. Consider using a tool like MailTrack to monitor when your resume is opened by a recruiter. This can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your application and help you determine when to follow up.
If you have completed a bachelor's degree or higher, it is generally unnecessary to include information about your high school education.
Always proofread your resume for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors. Utilize tools like Grammarly or ask a trusted friend or family member to review it for you.
A hobbies and interests section can be included if you have extra space and no additional relevant experience to highlight. However, keep in mind that this section is unlikely to be a deciding factor in whether you are selected for an interview.
If you haven't received a response within a week of submitting your application, consider following up with the recruiter or hiring manager. Use an email tracking tool to determine whether your initial application was opened, and tailor your follow-up message accordingly.
Remember that resume advice can be subjective and may vary depending on the recruiter, industry, and company culture. Be open to feedback and willing to adapt your approach, but also trust your instincts and highlight the experiences and skills that make you a unique and valuable candidate.
