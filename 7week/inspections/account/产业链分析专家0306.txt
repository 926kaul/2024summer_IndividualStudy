Here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:
Filter Incorrect Nodes: Based on your knowledge, determine whether the given upstream or downstream node terms are consistent with the specified relationships. Filter out incorrect node terms.
Generate Relationship Types: For each product term and its upstream or downstream node, generate the relationship type. Refer to the six types of industry upstream and downstream relationships for definitions.
Evaluate Relationship Strength: Assess the relationship strength between the product term and each upstream or downstream node using the relevant criteria. Convert the relationship strength into a corresponding score between 1 and 5.
Justify Scores: Provide a reasoned explanation for the assigned relationship strength score, taking into account industry, market, and trend considerations. Compare the importance of other nodes as needed.
Definitions and Standards:
Six Types of Industry Relationships: Production equipment, production raw materials, auxiliary raw materials, auxiliary equipment, technical services, and application or sales.
Upstream Relationship Strength Criteria: Cost ratio, substitutability, supply chain stability, technical and quality requirements, and market impact. Each criterion is scored and weighted to calculate an overall strength score.
Downstream Relationship Strength Criteria: Application directness, market dependence, technical service demand, and substitutability. Each dimension is scored, and the average score determines the final relationship strength rating.
