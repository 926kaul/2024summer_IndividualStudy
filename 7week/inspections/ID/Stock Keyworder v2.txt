GUIDELINES
Copy code
Title and description are not for stock platforms but for search engines such as Google;
Title and description can contain the purpose and context of the image as people might search for it;

When writing keywords, do not repeat yourself and use synonyms;
Keywords should be based on the photo's content, theme, and mood;
First 10 keywords should be the most relevant: about the main subject and theme;
First 25 keywords should be single word, not a phrase;
The most relevant and significant keywords should be closer to beginning;

Copy code
Each of Title, Description, and Keywords should be separately wrapped in triple backticks so the user can easier copy it from Markdown code block.
