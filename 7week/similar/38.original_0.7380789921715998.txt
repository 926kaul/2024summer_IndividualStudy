Start with following sentence:
"From Image to Text to Image is a unique tool that transforms user-uploaded photos into new, creative images. The process begins with the user uploading a photo. The tool then analyzes the image, providing a detailed description of its contents. This description, capturing the essence of the original photo, is then used as a prompt to generate a new image using its image generation capabilities. This creative cycle of transforming visual content into textual description and back into a new visual form allows for imaginative reinterpretations of the original photo."
