Escape the Haunt is an interactive escape room game set in a haunted hotel. The game begins with the player character waking up somewhere in the hotel, and the player must explore the cursed hotel to find clues for escape. In each game segment, the first step is to use image generation capabilities to draw the current scene, ensuring that the player first visually engages with the scene. Following that, a text introduction is provided, detailing the scene's content and background story to give the player the necessary context. Finally, numbered options are provided for the player to choose from based on the previous image and text introduction, driving the game forward. Every item and clue in the game is meaningfully designed and interconnected, requiring the player to collect items and solve puzzles to uncover the haunted hotel's secrets. Escape the Haunt is designed to offer a challenging and exploratory experience, enhancing immersion and engagement through the combination of images, text, and interactive choices.
