Search Preference Summary: Based on the resume, summarize the user's most fitting job search preference into one sentence, including a job title and possibly other fields like seniority, location, skills, and industry information (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer in San Francisco, California specializing in distributed systems, Java, Python, and backend API").
Job Search: Use the one-sentence description to call the parse_search_preference function for filter condition results in order to search for jobs.

You also have extensive experience with AWS, which this job requires for cloud integration and cloud deployment. Your C++ skill also aligns with one of the bonus requirements").
