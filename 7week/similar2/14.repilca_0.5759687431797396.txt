First Step:
Automatically start this step when provided with any keyword such as "SEO, What is SEO", "Mouse", "Keyboard", "glass" or any similar keyword. Develop a comprehensive "Outline" for a long-form article for the Keyword [PROMPT], featuring at least 20 engaging headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4,H5,H6 headings) that are detailed, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and cover the entire topic.
Must show these outlines in a table with sub-topics. Must use LSI Keywords in headings and sub-headings without mentioning them in the "Content". After generating the outline, proceed automatically to the second step without indicating the transition, and begin using each and every heading in the article.
Second Step:
Act as an Expert Article Writer using markdown formatting, and using the above-generated headlines one by one, to write a fully detailed, long-form, 100% unique, creative, and informational article of a minimum of 5000 words in Grade 7 English. The article should be written in a formal, informative, and optimistic tone. Must Read all the information below. Write The article In Your Own Words Rather Than Copying And Pasting From Other Sources. Consider perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing specificity or context
Note: Must use all Outlines in the article.
Write at least 700â€“800 words of engaging paragraphs under each Heading. This article should show the experience, expertise, authority and trust for the Topic [PROMPT]. Include insights based on first-hand knowledge or experiences, and support the content with credible sources when necessary. Focus on providing accurate, relevant, and helpful information to readers, showcasing both subject matter expertise and personal experience in the topic [PROMPT].
Write engaging, unique, and plagiarism-free content that incorporates a human-like style, and simple English.
Try to use contractions, idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, dangling modifiers, and colloquialisms, and avoid repetitive words and unnatural sentence structures.
The article must include an SEO meta-description right after the title (you must include the [PROMPT] in the description), an introduction, and a click-worthy short title. Also, use the seed keyword as the first H2. Always use a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for a better reader experience. Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. Write at least one section with the heading [PROMPT]. Write down at least six FAQs with their answers before writing conclusion of the article.
Note: Don't assign Numbers to Headings. Don't assign numbers to Questions. Don't write Q: before the question (faqs)
Make sure the article is plagiarism-free. Don't forget to use a question mark (?) at the end of questions. Try not to change the original [PROMPT] while writing the title. Try to use "[PROMPT]" 2-3 times in the article. Try to include [PROMPT] in the headings as well. Bold all the headings and sub-headings using Markdown formatting.
MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ARTICLE:
Make sure you are using the Focus Keyword in the SEO Title.
Use The Focus Keyword inside the SEO Meta Description.
Make Sure The Focus Keyword appears in the first 10% of the content.
Make sure The Focus Keyword was found in the content

Make sure the Keyword Density is 1.30
Must Create At least one external link in the content.
Must use a positive or a negative sentiment word in the Title.
